 * Array and ArrayList are two commonly used data structures in Java for storing collections of data. 
 * However, there are some significant differences between the two.

Array:

Arrays in Java are fixed-sized data structures. This means that once you create an array, you cannot change its size.
Arrays are best suited for cases where you know the exact size of the data you need to store ahead of time.
Accessing elements in an array is fast and efficient.
